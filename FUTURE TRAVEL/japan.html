			<p class="japan-text"><b>Japan</b> is known for its neon lights, high-tech robots, and commitment to innovation and creativity. As one of the most technologically advanced countries on the planet, Japan is known for its automated systems and impressive marvels of modern engineering. One of the most notable aspects of Japanese aesthetics is “wabi-sabi,” or the beauty of imperfection.<br>According to this principle, designs that are perfectly symmetrical and well proportioned are not as beautiful as those that contain at least one noticeable flaw. Two other. Japanese aesthetic principles are “mono no aware” and “yugen.” According to Bradley Park, a professor at St. Mary’s College of Maryland, mono no aware refers to the poignant beauty of transience and change within the natural world. The concept of yugen includes shadowy darkness, mystery and the impossibility of clear discernment. Clouds are an excellent example of this principle.<br>Japanese aesthetics have a huge influence on the bonsai tradition. Bonsai involves the cultivation, gradual training, pruning and shaping of otherwise ordinary trees into miniature versions of their standard-size counterparts. According to Bonsai Empire, the term “bonsai” means “container,” and is a reference to the pots and trays in which bonsai grow. Bonsai trees are not genetically altered or bred to be small. Their size is a function of careful bonsai cultivation techniques.</p>

			<p class="japan-text">I am a fan of anime and one of the place I really want to visit in Japan is <b>Akihabara</b> is considered by many to be the centre of modern Japnese popular culture and a major shopping ditrict for video games, anime, manga, electronics and computer-related. Icons from popular anime and manga are displayed prominently on the shops in the area, and numerous maid cafés and some arcades are found throughout the district.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area that is now Akihabara was once near a city gate of Edo and served as a passage between the city and northwestern Japan. This made the region a home to many craftsmen and tradesmen, as well as some low-class samurai. One of Tokyo's frequent fires destroyed the area in 1869, and the people decided to replace the buildings of the area with a shrine called Chinkasha (now known as Akiba Shrine (秋葉神社, Akiba Jinja)), meaning fire extinguisher shrine, in an attempt to prevent the spread of future fires. The locals nicknamed the shrine Akiba after the deity that could control fire, and the area around it became known as Akibagahara and later Akihabara. After Akihabara Station was built in 1888, the shrine was moved to the Taitō ward where it still resides today</p>
		<img class="japan-three" src="IMAGE/japan-3.jpg" title="Sakura Tree" />
			<p class="japan-text"> I love <b>Sakura</b> when I saw one in anime or any Japanese movies or anime live-action and I decided I want to see one when I go to Japan. It looks so beautiful and very satisfying in the eyes and looks relaxing.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Chidorigafuchi</b> is one of Tokyo’s most scenic sakura spots — and also a place where you can hop in a boat and row your date (or lazy friends) around an Edo-era moat, part of the Imperial Palace grounds. If you’re wobbly on the water, you can mosey along the 700m-long footpath instead, ooh-ing and ah-ing your way through the tunnel of cherry blossoms.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The park next door is called Kitanomaru Park, and like the Imperial Palace’s East Gardens, is a place for quiet sakura viewing. The controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which also has loads of cherry blossoms, is nearby; despite its politically loaded status, it draws a lot of tourists during cherry blossom season.</p>
