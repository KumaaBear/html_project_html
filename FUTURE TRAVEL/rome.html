	<h1>Rome</h1>
	<div class="rome-container">
		<img class="rome-one" src="IMAGE/rome-1.jpg" title="Colosseum" />
			<p class="rome-text">If the Eiffel Tower is the identity of Paris, you can’t imagine Rome without <b>Colosseum</b>. This Flavian amphitheatre was started to build from AD 72 and completed in AD 80. The large amphitheatre is holding the glorious past of the Roman Empire which was the centre of theatres, sports, festivals, circuses and lots of other occasions.</p>
			<p class="rome-text">The levels are designated for a different class of people in society. You will be spellbound at the magnanimity of the Colosseum. If you are in Rome, this is a must-visit. And while visiting this, you should also check out the Arco di Costantino standing nearby to complete your tour.</p>
			<p class="rome-text">In the Colosseum is where the Romans fight till to death just for entertainment back then. People enjoying watching them like that. I am a some how fan of Romans and the Greek mytholgy of them. When it comes to movies I really love it how it was made and flow of the story. The spartans and such.</p>
		<img class="rome-two" src="IMAGE/rome-2.jpg" title="Arch of Constantine" />
			<br><p class="rome-text"><b>Arco di Costantino</b> or as translated Arch of Constantine is one of the most preserved monuments of its kind in Rome. It is majestically standing just opposite the Colosseum, so it can’t be missed!

			The Arch was built on the order of the Roman Senate in 315 to celebrate the victory of Emperor Constantine over Maxentius and his accession to power. Constantine the Great is often referred to as the first Christian emperor.</p>
		<img class="rome-three" src="IMAGE/rome-3.jpg" title="Pantheon" />
			<p class="rome-text"> <b>The Arch of Constantine</b> I, erected in c. 315 CE, stands in Rome and commemorates Roman Emperor Constantine's victory over the Roman tyrant Maxentius on 28th October 312 CE at the battle of Milvian Bridge in Rome. It is the largest surviving Roman triumphal arch and the last great monument of Imperial Rome. The arch is also a tour de force of political propaganda, presenting Constantine as a living continuation of the most successful Roman emperors, renowned for their military victories and good government.</p>
		<img class="rome-four" src="IMAGE/rome-4.jpg" title="St. Peter’s Basilica" />
			<p class="rome-text">If you go on listing down the best places to visit in Rome, <b>Pantheon</b> will be within the top 5 countdowns. The sky-high building is really magnificent that will leave you amazed. The architecture of the outside of this building is breathtaking.</p>
			<p class="rome-text">And the murals you will find here will again remind you of the glorious Renaissance period in Rome. The paintings are great works of elite artists, like Raphael. With the beautiful interior and the extraordinary dome, Pantheon is worth to visit.</p>
			<p class="rome-text">The Pantheon has such a beautiful place and works of art there, I am looking forward to visiting the Pantheon and singing Go the Distance. Just like Hercules when he is going to find who he is. The cartoon Hercules is one of the reasons why I love Rome and its Greek mythology, you can also include the Olympus Guardian, it is a Korean animation of Greek Mythology and it has moral lessons too.</p>
			<p class="rome-text">You are in Rome and not visiting the <b>Vatican City</b> will be a real miss. This is the smallest independent state in the world. The half a square kilometre area is enclosed by the Vatican walls. While you are here, you should visit the great palace, St. Peter’s Basilica and also the garden, or, of course, St. Peter’s Square.</p>
		<img  class="rome-five" src="IMAGE/rome-5.jpg" title="St. Peter’s Basilica" />
			<p class="rome-text">The entire area is ruled by the Pope, the supreme authority of Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church. Apart from the great basilica, tourists will also find museums interesting. In the museum, you will be mesmerized by the great creation of Michelangelo’s Pieta along with other masterpieces of great artists.</p>
			<p class="rome-text">Visiting the Vatican City is one of my goals from the start I started loving every place in Rome. I love the structure of every building there and how they were built. Every statue there amazes me. The view is so nice and peaceful for me. I love Vatican City not because it is like a Holy place but because I think it is so beautiful and lovable place in Rome.</p>
