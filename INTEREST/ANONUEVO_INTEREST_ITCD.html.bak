	<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><sup>1</sup></b>My first <strong>skill</strong> is drawing, tho the art style is not that good like the other artists that people usually will see when they are scrolling on Facebook or the people doing an art commission.<b><sup>2</sup></b> I started to draw when I was Grade 1 student.<b><sup>3</sup></b> It makes me happy when I draw something that comes to my mind.<b><sup>4</sup></b> I love coloring things and even improve my coloring day by day.<b><sup>5</sup></b> The way that I color right now is far from the others because of some reason.<b><sup>6</sup></b> I used to practice my drawing, shading, and coloring, but it's all in the past now.<b><sup>7</sup></b> Sometimes I still draw when I am bored, but my art style is still at the beginner level and has never improved.<b><sup>8</sup></b> I also think that I have skills when planting some plants? I think so.<b><sup>9</sup></b> My mother and father once told me that I have a green thumb.<b><sup>10</sup></b> I remember when I picked some branch on the plant of our neighbor and I planted it in our front yard.<b><sup>11</sup></b> After a few weeks, the plant grew and, it looked healthy.<b><sup>12</sup></b> From that day, my mom let me plant vegetables in our yard.<b><sup>13</sup></b> At that time, I was only 6-years old or 7-years old.<b><sup>14</sup></b> But I loved planting plants when I was that age.<b><sup>15</sup></b> I don't know the exact reason why I loved playing at muds when I was a child.<b><sup>16</sup></b> The other skill of mine is that I always push myself to be cooperative when there was, always teamwork or group work.<b><sup>17</sup></b> Having good communication with others while you're on a team is a good advantage for the whole team.<b><sup>18</sup></b> Working together and being honest is good teamwork for all.<b><sup>19</sup></b> When others know that you're good to communicate and you are true to them, they will approach you for the better.<b><sup>20</sup></b> I think that's all about my skills.

<h2 id="hobbies"><u>HOBBIES</u></h2>
	<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><sup>1</sup></b>My <strong>hobbies</strong> are watching anime on weekends, digital or traditional drawing, but I am not that good at it.<b><sup>2</sup></b> I start to draw when I am bored and never try to improve my drawing.<b><sup>3</sup></b> I love watching anime. Anime makes me feel like I am alive in another way of my life.<b><sup>4</sup></b> I always spend my time watching anime or doing what will make me satisfied.<b><sup>5</sup></b> When it comes to arts, I am a lazy person so I never tried to improve it.<b><sup>6</sup></b> I love animating my drawing when I am bored but it does not look good in my eyes.<b><sup>7</sup></b> I love drawing like the art styles of anime.<b><sup>8</sup></b> I tried sketching once, but my hands are sweaty it making the paper wet.<b><sup>9</sup></b> For my other hobbies? I don't know if it will be a hobby, but I love eating. Eating foods makes me ease somehow.<b><sup>10</sup></b> I think I am gaining weight this year and last year.<b><sup>11</sup></b> I play games too.<b><sup>12</sup></b> I love playing online games with my friends.<b><sup>13</sup></b> I play Ragnarok, MIR4, Mobile Legends Bang Bang, Genshin Impact, Shop Titans, Honkai Impact, and many more.<b><sup>14</sup></b> Most of the games I play Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) and Role-Playing Game (RPG).<b><sup>15</sup></b> I met many good people in the game and spent time playing with them.<b><sup>16</sup></b> That moment when you talk to other people with the same taste of games, anime, and such.<b><sup>17</sup></b> I do not have so many hobbies but doing all those things makes me happy.<b><sup>18</sup></b> Should I consider sleeping as a hobby? I love sleeping.<b><sup>19</sup></b> Sleeping when I have to do nothing is one of the best feelings.<b><sup>20</sup></b> Your body is relaxed after a tiring day.<b><sup>21</sup></b> Sometimes I do crochet for our pet cat.   </blockquote></p>
